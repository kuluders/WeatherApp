## Running this project

The Weather App was developed using Replit and easiest way of running it and exploring the code is there: https://replit.com/@kuluders

In terms of running it locally best way to go about it is using `npm run dev`.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started

- Hit run
- Edit [App.tsx](#src/App.tsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)
